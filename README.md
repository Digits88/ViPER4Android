## ViPER4Android Magisk v13 and v14 module

This is a simple V4A module, for no frills setup - you simply grab it, flash it and use it.

No configuration, no additional frameworks, no special requirements, no hacks, no mess. It just works.

Module is based on [original module](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/ViPER4Android/) made by [topjohnwu](https://github.com/topjohnwu).

Uses ViPER4Android 2.5.0.4 driver and **includes** Viper4Android app, so you don't have to install anything.

**WARNING**: Since V4A app is systemlessly installed into /system/priv-app (just to stop your ROM from killing V4A too often), this module is possibly incompatible with AppSystemizer and similar modules and may cause undesirable/unpredictable behaviour when installed in conjuction with it. Be aware of this. If you want to use this module without provided app, edit updater-script manually or open an issue here/contact me on XDA to make flashable module without provided app.
